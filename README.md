# ChatGPT
All code created using Chat GPT, https://chat.openai.com/chat, which is an open AI

Using the following instructions (and a little modification) I was able to create these wed components using the ChatGPT tool. Each set of instructions were sent one after another, to modify the code

1. DVD
    - make a code using css and and html boiler plate to make a bouncing DVD loading screen that starts at a random position on the page and bounces when it hits the edge, but when it hits the corner of the page it changes the background color to purple
    - change the code so if the dvd gets within 20 pixels of the corner the background changes
    - make a counter on the page that adds one every time the corner is hit
    - center the counter on the top page, above the dvd
